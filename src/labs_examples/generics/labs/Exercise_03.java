/**
 * Generics Exercise 3:
 *
 *      Create a class with a generic method that accepts two generic arguments. This generic method should only accept
 *      arguments which are sublasses of Number. The generic method must return the sum (as a double) of whatever two
 *      numbers were passed in regardless of their type.
