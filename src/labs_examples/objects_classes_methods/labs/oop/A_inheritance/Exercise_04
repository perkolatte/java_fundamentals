Without running the code below, please tell me what it will print.

"Parent called" will print, as the Child object, because it was initialized as type Parent, only has access to Parent's methods.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
    c.doSomething();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
