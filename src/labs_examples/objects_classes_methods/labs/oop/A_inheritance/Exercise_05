Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

"Parent called" will print, as the Child object, because it was initialized as type Parent, only has access to Parent's methods, including constructors.

Hmmm, tested, and apparently both print (Parent, then Child), so the Child constructor is accessible.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
