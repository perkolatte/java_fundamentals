 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *

 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id

 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Populate each table with at least 5 records.
 *
 *      6.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students
                SELECT * FROM college.students;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)
                SELECT * FROM college.teachers
                WHERE subject='math';

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher
                SELECT  s.first_name AS student_first_name,
                		s.last_name AS student_last_name,
                		t.first_name AS teacher_first_name,
                        t.last_name AS teacher_last_name
                FROM college.students s
                JOIN college.teachers_students ts
                	ON s.id = ts.student_id
                JOIN college.teachers t
                	ON ts.teacher_id = t.id
                WHERE t.first_name = 'natalie' AND t.last_name = 'werve';

 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject
                SELECT  s.first_name AS student_first_name,
                		s.last_name AS student_last_name,
                		c.name
                FROM college.students s
                JOIN college.students_courses sc
                	ON s.id = sc.student_id
                JOIN college.courses c
                	ON sc.course_id = c.id
                WHERE c.name = 'computer science';

 *          e. update a record in the student table
                UPDATE college.students
                	SET age=29
                WHERE id = 5;

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table
                INSERT INTO college.teachers
                	VALUES (6, 'rumplstiltskin', 'funkypants', 'art');

 *
 *       7.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
