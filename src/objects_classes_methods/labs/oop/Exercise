In this section we'll be creating a small Object Oriented Application. The various exercises will build on each other.

Let's model a blackjack game! The game we'll be creating will be very simple. It will be "first to 21".
It will not ask for bets. The user and the computer will each start with a small pot and bets will be taken automatically.

1) Create four classes (each in their own file with the same name as the class):
    BlackjackController.java (this will contain the main())
    Player.java (POJO - this will contain player info)
        String name;
        Hand hand;
    Card.java (POJO - this will hold card data)
        char[] suit = new char[]{'♠', '♦', '♥', '♣'};

    Deck.java (POJO - this will hold deck data)
    Hand.java (POJO - this will hold Hand data)


2) Fill out each POJO above to the best of your ability. Also create a main() method in the BlackJackController class.

3) Create at least two (overloaded) constructors for each of the POJO's above.
