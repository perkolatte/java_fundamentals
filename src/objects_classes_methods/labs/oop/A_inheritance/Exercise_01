1) Create at least 5 classes that demonstrate an inheritance hierachy. The depth of the hiearchy must be at least 3. Meaning:
A extends B, B extends C. Classes A, B, and C define an inheritance hierachy with a depth of 3. Create a real-world
inheritance hierachy. For instance you could create an inheritance hiearchy using animals, or food, or the solar system,
or stores, restaurants, adventures, and really anything else you can imagine. Have some fun with it. Try to challenge
yourself.

2) Once you've created this hiearchy, demonstrate the use of non-default constructors in the parent classes. Meaning,
use the super(arg1, arg2, ...) command from a subclass to invoke a parameterized constructor in the parent class. Do this
at least once, several times over would be better.

3) Create at least three methods that override a method in one or more parent classes.

4) Create a controller class/method that will create objects of your hiearchy and demonstrate how you use this inheritance
hiearchy. Demonstrate that your subclasses have set the variables in the parent classes, that you have called the parameterized
super constructors from sub-classes, that you are indeed overriding methods.
